# QA-chana: 👩🏾‍🦱 Drone view of my QA Personality 👀:


**🧠 Philosophy:** Nothing is perfect, so there is always something to improve upon and I like to point out what can be improved upon when it comes to products.


**🧑🏾‍💻 Approach:** Collaboration is the key, team work yields better result. I like to establish processes where everyone can collaborate and help each other succeed. QA is a bridge between product and engineering. 


**🔬 Testing Strategies:** Manual, Automation, Performance and Neatness around Project Management Tools


**🤖 Automation Preferences:**
  My preferred IDE is **_pycharm_** but I am teaching myself **_Vim+Nerdtree_**
  - `pytest-bdd` because behaviour driven development helps to communicate the requirements throughout departments
  - `pytest`/`python` because it makes life easy
  - `selenium`/`splinter` for UI automation and `request` library for api testing
    
    **Past Experience:**
    Additionally to the tooling mentioned as my preferred tech:
    - `specflow` which is BDD tooling that is used with .NET
    - `HP UFT(QTP)` which is an object repository tool that uses VB Script for Legacy applications


**📈 Performance Testing:**
  - `Locust` for performance testing scripts which uses python
  - `Dynatrace` for the cool dashboards to monitor the performance metrics
  - `AWS Performance Insights` for Database monitoring
    
    **Past Experience:**
    - `Kibana`


**🫀 OS Perferences:** `Linux`(I can adapt to any distros), `MacOS`(But I hope you support Linux distros)
  - Current fav: Arch Linux ❤️


**💃🏾 Fun Stuff:** Poledancing, Motorcycles, Day-dreaming and Music + Books Explorer
