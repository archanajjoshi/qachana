# QA-chana
üë©üèæ‚Äçü¶± How so I QA stuffs? Here are some details:

**Philosophy:** Nothing is perfect, so there is always something to improve upon and I like to point out what can be improved upon when it comes to products.

**Approach:** Collaboration is the key, team work yields better result. I like to establish processes where everyone can collaborate and help each other succeed. QA is a bridge between product and engineering. 

**Testing** **Strategies:** Manual, Automation, Performance and Neatness around Project Management Tools

**Automation** **Preferences:**
  My preferred IDE is **_pycharm_** but I am teaching myself **_Vim+Nerdtree_**
  - `pytest-bdd` because behaviour driven development helps to communicate the requirements throughout departments
  - `pytest`/`python` because it makes life easy
  - `selenium`/`splinter` for UI automation and `request` library for api testing

    **Past Experience:**
    - `specflow` which is BDD tooling that is used with .NET
    - `HP UFT(QTP)` which is an object repository tool that uses VB Script for Legacy applications

**Performance Testing:**
  - `Locust` for performance testing scripts which uses python
  - `Dynatrace` for the cool dashboards to monitor the performance metrics
  - `AWS Performance Insights` for Database monitoring

    **Past Experience:**
    - `Kibana`

**OS Perferences:** `Linux`(I can adapt to any distros), `MacOS`(But I hope you support Linux distros)
  - Current fav: Arch Linux ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Fun Stuff:** Poledancing, Motorcycle enthu, Day-dreaming
